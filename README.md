This repo is used to create first fully-working web application or web page.
All is being done through Edunova organisation that is providing us materials to work on, great teacher and a fair schedule from a "do-it-yourself" stand point.

UPDATE 1: In this project are used: MariaDB & PHP

UPDATE 2: My final project is a simple social network Twitter look-a-like.

UPDATE 3: Versions of my final work are in Bootstrap. Foundation and custom template frameworks.

UPDATE 4: Best looking frameworks so far are Bootstrap and custom template so I will be continuing on them because Foundation is (I think) not for me.

UPDATE 5: Final work is done with MVC principle which includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) options.
